I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at [Qiuzhen College](https://qzc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) ([Yau Mathematical Sciences Center](https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/)), Tsinghua University, co-supervised by Prof. Yuan Zhou and Prof. Zhenhua Li. Before that, I obtained my B.Sc. from [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.nju.edu.cn/mainm.htm) at Nanjing University in 2023.

As I am trained with both computer system techniques and mathematical skills, some interdisciplinary topic are more suitable for me, like theoretical foundations of machine learning, mathematic modelling and machine learning systems.

**Hobbies**

I LOVE any electronic music with deep bass, especially psychedellic trance, dubstep (or, drum and bass) and some hardcore. As many electronic music of high quality can be found in rhythm games, I am enthusiastic about Arcaea, Cytus and so forth.

Other popular EDMs (Electric dance music), like progressive/electro/slap house, are rather only acceptable for me, while they are highly prevalant among most peoples.

Fun fact: Su often uses trance to trance himself before sleeping!

Some other hobbies, like reading (in psychology and society), fitting, photographing, are under exploring.
